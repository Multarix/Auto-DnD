Jobs are going to link back into classes & Race

This means that:
1. These jobs are just going to serve as a basis to define classes
2. Stats do not need to be in these with a select few as exception
(eg. Merchants, Prostitutes [They are so generic that any class and race can fit those jobs but both have high charisma most likely])
3. This makes life a little easier, they're supposed to be generic throw away npcs/ give an idea of what stats you should be looking at.
